# OS X App Extras

This outlines some extra things that are currently manually installed in OS X. There are some basics that I always install, such as:

- Dropbox
- Docker
- Evernote
- 1Password
- Divvy
- Atom
- LaunchBar

They come from the App Store or elsewhere. This document outlines some of the settings or modules that those apps use that aren't part of an automated install for whatever reason. Hopefully this list is short ðŸ™‚

## LaunchBar

- [Timer Action](https://s3.amazonaws.com/renaghan/lbdist/Timer.lbaction) for setting arbitrary timers right inside of LB as an action. Ex: "Take a break 20m"
